# Miscellaneous Requirements

## Authentication and User Data Handling

1.  **Data Caching on Logout**: When a user logs out, any user-specific data displayed on the current page must be immediately cleared. The application should not retain or display data from the previous session.

2.  **Routing on Logout**:
    *   If the current route remains valid for an unauthenticated user, the content should switch to a user-neutral or public state, without revealing any prior user data.
    *   If the current route becomes invalid after logout (i.e., it's a protected route), the user must be redirected to the nearest parent route that is valid for an unauthenticated user. In the worst-case scenario, redirect to the homepage (`/`).
